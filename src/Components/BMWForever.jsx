            Life has many unforgettable moments in store for us. Some, we think
            back on fondly; others, less so. But every one of them is unique.
            That is why a BMW is more than just a method of transportation. It
            is a companion that creates space for emotion and allows us to feel
            the joy which lives within every single moment. Dive into the
            emotional farewell drive in this video, and discover exclusive
            behind-the-scenes recordings from the film production.
